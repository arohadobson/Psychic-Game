# Psychic Guessing Game

This game is a simple game of 'guess what i'm thinking'.

## How To Play

When you're ready to start the game, you should begin randomly selecting letters. If you select the same letter the computer is thinking, you gain a point, however, if you run out of guesses before finding the correct letter then the computer gains a point! don't worry about guessing the same letter twice, your already used letters will appear in the last line of the game! Have fun!
